Files that make their way into most of my configs

.spectrwm.conf and baraction.sh are works in progress. The former I can get a handle on. The latter is over my head, so I'll learn by tutorials others provide. It's not priority, just a hobby.

The fonts need their own folder, but the repo is small.
